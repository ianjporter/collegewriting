    <h1>Distinguishing Your Ideas from Others' in College Writing</h1>
    <p>In college writing, you explore ideas and perspectives and make arguments. As you do, it's important to make clear to your reader whose ideas and perspectives you are engaging with and responding to, and how your ideas and perspectives relate to others'. You can apply this learning to writing papers, preparing presentation slides, or creating multimedia projects like websites and videos.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>

    <h3>Join the Conversation</h3>
    <p>When you write in college, you are joining a kind of "conversation" with other writers and thinkers. That conversation doesn't happen in person, but rather over time in written texts. It's a helpful metaphor for thinking about writing in college.</p>

    <h3>Explore Ideas and Debates</h3>
    <p>By showing the relationship between others' ideas and perspectives and your own, you help your reader understand the issues that motivate discussion and debate.</p>

    <h3>Developing Voice and Original Ideas</h3>
    <p>By reading, reflecting on, and writing about others' ideas and perspectives, you develop critical thinking skills that allow you test your own assumptions and preconceptions. Ultimately, you develop your own voice and perspective.</p>

    <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
    <p>Showing your readers where you learned something from or where you got an idea makes you trustworthy and credible. Also, you show respect to other authors by reading, referencing, and citing their work. And, of course, you avoid the P word: plagiarism.</p>

    <h2>"They Say / I Say" Model</h2>
    <div class="citation">
        <p>Citation: Graff, Gerald, and Cathy Birkenstein. “They Say / I Say” : The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing. Sixth edition., W.W. Norton & Company, 2024.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Academic Writing as Conversation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Talk with others through writing by showing what "They say" and responding to it with what "I say"</li>
        <li>Emphasizes Dialogue</li>
        <li>Highlights different perspectives</li>
        <li>Shows the relationship between different perspectives</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Applying "They Say / I Say"</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>They Say:</b> Present others' views accurately and fairly.</li>
        <li><b>Choose How to Respond:</b> Choose to agree, disagree, or both.</li>
        <li><b>I Say:</b> Respond with your own ideas and perspective.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Three Key Techniques for Integrating Sources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Summarizing:</b> Condense an author's main ideas concisely in your own words.</li>
        <li><b>Paraphrasing:</b> Restate ideas using your own language and style.</li>
        <li><b>Quoting:</b> Use exact words sparingly, with proper attribution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summarizing: Capturing the Essence</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Condense Main Ideas:</b> Use your own words to capture the main point.</li>
        <li><b>Be Brief:</b> Usually a few sentences to a paragraph in length.</li>
        <li><b>Provide Overview:</b> Use for general understanding of sources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Paraphrasing: Restating Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rewrite for your purpose:</b> Express ideas in your unique way.</li>
        <li><b>Preserve Meaning:</b> Keep the original sense intact.</li>
        <li><b>Show Understanding:</b> Demonstrate grasp of the material.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Quoting: Using Exact Words</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Use Sparingly:</b> Reserve for impactful phrases.</li>
        <li><b>Enclose in Quotes:</b> Clearly mark quoted material and put an in-text citation at the end of the sentence.</li>
        <li><b>Integrate Smoothly:</b> Blend quotes into your writing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Watch: Video on Summarizing, Paraphrasing, and Quoting Sources</h3>
    <h2>The Importance of Citing Sources</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Give Credit:</b> Acknowledge original authors' work</li>
        <li><b>Locate Sources:</b> Allow readers to find the information</li>
        <li><b>Build Your Credibility:</b> Demonstrate that you explored the conversation</li>
        <li><b>Avoid Plagiarism:</b> Prevent unethical use of others' work</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>In-Text Citations vs. Full Citation</h3>
    <p><b>In-Text Citation:</b> An in-text citation is a brief reference within your writing or presentation that indicates the source of information. It usually includes the author's last name and the year of publication.</p>
    <p><i>Example: (Hassan 2023)</i></p>

    <p><b>Full Citation in Works Cited (MLA) or References (APA):</b> A full bibliographic citation provides complete details about the source, enabling readers to locate it. It includes the author, year, title, and publication information.</p>
    <p><i>Example: Hassan, M. (2023). The Title of the Book. Publisher.</i></p>

    <h3>Watch: Video on In-Text Citation</h3>
    <h3>In-Text Citations and Works Cited/References in Slides, Web Pages and Videos</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Presentation Slides:</b> When citing a source in a presentation slide, include a brief in-text citation directly on the slide, typically near the cited material. Then, include a Works Cited/References slide at the end of the presentation with the full citation.</li>
        <li><b>Web Pages:</b> For web pages, in-text citations can be placed within the text, often linking to a full citation at the end of the article or page. Then, include a Works Cited/References section at the end of the web page.</li>
        <li><b>Videos:</b> In videos, in-text citations can be displayed as on-screen text or mentioned verbally by the speaker, with a full citation in the video description. Then, include a Works Cited/References at the end of the video.</li>
    </ul>
